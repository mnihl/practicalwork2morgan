# Practical Work II - Morgan Nihlmar

This is the repository for my Practical Work II, a software development project from the University Francisco de Vitoria where I am required to create a functional website.

# Actions

- Added the basic structure and organization of the project
- Created the homepage, navbar, and footers that will be shared on all the other html pages
- Added image files that will be used in the content of the various html pages
- Completed the about me content



# DDD (Design Detailed Document)

## Description

- I began with creating the base structure of the project so that I could be more organized, I created all the requisite files such as the index.html, README, .gitignore, and then the directories required for the project. I added each html file inside "public" individually and pushed afterwards, as was stated in the rules to properly track and version the project. 
- Due to some time pressure I felt a bit unsure about how to proceed with the project as I always struggle with putting in "filler" content in situations like this. But you need filler content to realize the goals of the webpage so I spent a lot of time overthinking and editing things that technically do not matter for the project, the grading is about your organization, structure, showcasing skills learned in class, and I end up wasting a lot of time thinking about what to write in the paragraph elements.
- For the "About me" section I wrote a little bit about myself and included information about my home university too, to showcase where I came from before attending this exchange semester. 

## Problems encountered

- I was not sure if it was correct or acceptable to create all the HTML files at first, without working on them at all. I did the separate pushes as stated but maybe it was meant that you should finish each HTML file before creating the next. Anyway, it was how I decided to proceed with my project as I like to have all things organized first.
- The aforementioned problem in the description about not knowing what to fill in text-wise in this project made me lose a lot of time and confidence in myself. It also made it hard to test the website without content, Lorem Ipsum texts are a solution to this of course. 
- I worried if citing the sources of all images was necessary for this project.
