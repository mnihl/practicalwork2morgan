# DDD (Design Detailed Document)

## Description

- I began with creating the base structure of the project so that I could be more organized, I created all the requisite files such as the index.html, README, .gitignore, and then the directories required for the project. I added each html file inside "public" individually and pushed afterwards, as was stated in the rules to properly track and version the project. 
- Due to some time pressure I felt a bit unsure about how to proceed with the project as I always struggle with putting in "filler" content in situations like this. But you need filler content to realize the goals of the webpage so I spent a lot of time overthinking and editing things that technically do not matter for the project, the grading is about your organization, structure, showcasing skills learned in class, and I end up wasting a lot of time thinking about what to write in the paragraph elements.
- For the "About me" section I wrote a little bit about myself and included information about my home university too, to showcase where I came from before attending this exchange semester. 
- I went with the topic from my Practical Work I group work for my Topic section, and gave a recap about the topic, why it interested me and us as a group, and why it is an exciting topic in general.
- For the degree page, there was a lot of content to fill in, I decided to make a table with the columns: Semester, Course, Category, as was requested in the specifications for this project. 
- I created the FCE page with information taken from the slides "Unit 0 - Intro"
- Added CSS styling to all pages, I went with blue and white/grey as the main colors of this webpage which correlates with the thematic colors of the university. The navbar and footer are always in blue while the content of the page is white and with black text to be the most legible, surrounded by a darker grey exterior shell around the page. I made the table containing the courses of my university degree as well the link to FCE information cover the entire page, so that the elements of the table were less crammed and it was not in the corner of the user's eyes but rather the center. 

## Problems encountered

- I was not sure if it was correct or acceptable to create all the HTML files at first, without working on them at all. I did the separate pushes as stated in the rules but maybe it was meant that you should finish each HTML file before creating the next. Anyway, it was how I decided to proceed with my project as I like to have all things organized first.
- The aforementioned problem in the description about not knowing what to fill in text-wise in this project made me lose a lot of time and confidence in myself. It also made it hard to test the website without content, Lorem Ipsum texts are a solution to this of course. 
- I worried if citing the sources of all images was necessary for this project. 
- Working with tables in html is very messy and can get confusing if you have a lot of row elements with lots of text cluttering up your html file. As of now I have not styled it either and am unsure how I will to make it more legible for the user/reader. 
- Unsure once again if it is accepted to use text and information taken from slides when descrbing FCE on fce.html
- Not exactly happy with the final design of the website and the styling of the table
- Maybe the UFV logo should link to UFV website, but decided not to do this.
- Wanted to make the footer "sticky" to the bottom, but was not able to find a way to do this via the means and resources we were taught in this courses, and it was not listed as a requirement, so I decided not to pursue that further either. 
- Overall styling and working with CSS is a weak point of mine, I feel I lack the overall "vision" of the websites I have created in the past and dislike styling and nitpicking and centering divs. I have found working with Bootstrap to be much more satisfying and functional but this was too much for this project. 
- The table or the way the degree courses were presented per year should be improved. 

## Conclusions

- It was an enjoyable and educational project. I have done projects like this before but find that the information goes out of your knowledge in your head quite fast unless you keep it up and continue to make web projects. The full requested functionality and features are provided by my project, as far as I have tested, and the rules have been followed. It went well but at the point of reaching CSS I personally struggle to make something cohesive and consistent that I am satisfied with. Dealing with color schemes, and minor adjustments to the location and presentation of certain page elements is something I find very tedious and even wasteful in terms of time. But it is sufficient and functional as I said before. The webpage provides about, topic, degree (with FCE subpage), net, and contact pages with the promised features contained within. All navbar and footer links function and images are properly referenced. Content is all original except for the FCE page where information about the course is quoted verbatim from the slides Unit 0 - Intro because these provide the literal and exact information about the course content, direction, and learning outcomes. Areas of improvement would be styling of certain elements, namely: table with courses, footer, form. Functionality and content wise, everything is provided.
