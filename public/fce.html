        <h2>Learning Outcomes:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Students must have demonstrated knowledge and understanding in an area of study that is founded on general
                secondary education. Moreover, the area of study is typically at a level that includes certain aspects implying
                knowledge at the forefront of its field of study, albeit supported by advanced textbooks.</li>
            <li>Students must be able to apply their knowledge to their work or vocation in a professional manner and possess skills
                that can typically be demonstrated by coming up with and sustaining arguments and solving problems within their field
                of study.</li>
            <li>Students must have the ability to gather and interpret relevant data (usually within their field of study) in order to make
                judgments that include reflections on pertinent social, scientific or ethical issues.</li>
            <li>Students must be able to convey information, ideas, problems and solutions to both an expert and non-expert
                audience.</li>
            <li>Students must have developed the learning skills needed to undertake further study with a high degree of
                independence.</li>
        </ul>
