<h1>Medical Robotics</h1>

    <h2>What is Medical Robotics?</h2>
    <p>Medical Robotics is the study of Robotics in the context of application within the field of medicine. The current and prospective
        uses of this field include but are not limited to, assisted or fully independent surgery, rehabilitation, and diagnostics.
        The field is rapidly expanding and is expected to revolutionize the way we approach medical treatment in the future. I, along with
    a group of 5 others did a project on this topic for our Fundamentals of Computer Engineering class, which involved a research paper and a presentation on the topic.

    <h2>Personal Interest - Why Medical Robotics?</h2>
    <p>
        As a group, we were inspired by the story of Zhang Xu. He was the head of Urology of a Chinese Hospital who performed
        a surgery on a prostate cancer patient in China from the city of Rome in Italy. It was done entirely remotely. The implications
        of this technology were incredible and it made us determined to choose this topic out of our other choices for the class and
        convince our classmates of it's amazing future applications, seeing as it will develop even more rapidly now with the advent of AI.
